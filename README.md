## About the "Word of the Year"
The "Word of the Year" is a significant term selected annually by certain countries, reflecting pivotal events or societal trends that have shaped the populace in recent months. Ranging from scientific terms like "COVID-19" to contemporary slang or emerging neologisms, each word encapsulates nuanced meanings.

# Goal of the project
This project endeavors to examine the semantic correlations among the various "Words of the Year" chosen by countries with accessible word databases from 2014 to 2024. Beyond the curiosity surrounding these selected words, the primary aim is to delve into the realm of word embeddings for enhanced comprehension. The project documents learning milestones, elucidated and summarized in a corresponding [blogpost](https://denisemueller.eu/wordoftheyear.html). Feel free to check it out for a guided journey through this repository!

# Method 
To facilitate comparative analysis, I extracted corresponding word embeddings for each term from pre-trained language models. Exploring various methodologies, my focus initially centered on GloVe, later transitioning to Bert. Additionally, I refined input data, progressing from minimalist datasets to more comprehensive ones. Subsequently, leveraging sense-making word embeddings, I employed 'Altair' for visualizing the findings.
