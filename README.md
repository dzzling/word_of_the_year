# Word of the year :sparkles:

## About
A "Word of the Year" is a special word some countrys choose each year reflecting important events concerning the country's population in the past months. While some words might be a scientific term like "COVID-19", others might be contemporary slang or neologisms containing more nuanced meaning.   
This project was created to analyse the semantic similarities between the different words all the countrys with available word databases chose from 2014 to 2024. In order to compare the words, I used the corresponding word embedding from pre-trained llms.

Besides the interest for the relation of the words of the year, this project serves predominantly the mean to learn and understand word embeddings. The project reflects learning stages, which were commented and summarized in a [blogpost](https://denisemueller.eu/wordoftheyear.html). Check it out, if you're interested in a more guided approach to this repository!
